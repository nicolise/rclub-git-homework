try image analysis scripts on github
and manuscript

bitbucket feature: private repos free for academics
github: repo turns into a website!

stage: place file in directory THEN stage - index for commit THEN commit
git does not do well with large non-text files

make .gitignore file
include file name patterns to match 
main directory == git init --> git repo here
/DATA
/scripts
/output
/paper
are the subdirectories
want git to ignore all but /scripts
define in .gitignore

different pieces of code in different directories within repo:
can stage in groups across directories -- collect everything that you want to be committed together
all or none

commit: changes permanent part in repository
can comment on change content of the commit

stage: internal control?
on command line:
$ git diff #and color words

can also stage lines/ hunks to a single commit

always pull before you push

data storage: dryad, SRA, iplant...
and include a readme that gives url for data // brief snippet describing data
can also include data as zipped in downloads on github

slow: committing large binary files (images, BAM, .bzip)

keep things updated across your OWN computers!!
